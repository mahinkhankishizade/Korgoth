Korgoth is a parser for a propositional logic and mathematical programming language,
which solves the problem the user codes by requiring less coding than the other languages.
Korgoth is not only simple but also functional. It aims to solve the mathematical problems in an easy way,
and identify variety of useful mathematical functions and expressions.

To run the parser, Linux environment is required.
On a linux terminal, go to the directory which contains the Korgoth src files (Korgoth.lex, Korgoth.yacc, Korgoth.test, Makefile).
First compile the parser by prompting "make", then type "make test" to test the input file.
You can edit Korgoth.test file or rewrite in Korgoth Language and test again.
To clean the temporary files, type "make clean" on terminal.
